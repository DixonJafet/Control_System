## ⚙️ Digital Control & Signal Processing Project

This project demonstrates **digital signal control** using a system of **logic gates** and **binary inputs**, implemented in **LogiSim**.

The system performs multiple arithmetic operations such as:
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication

All operations are handled using **digital logic circuits** — showcasing manual logic design and signal flow understanding.
